# shiprs

A rust wrapper for the Docker Engine API. This library is intended to use the minimal amount of dependencies and to be as close to the Docker Engine API as possible.

## Sources

This library is strongly inspired by the [shiplift](https://github.com/softprops/shiplift) and [bollard](https://github.com/fussybeaver/bollard/tree/master) libraries.

## Warning

This library is still in development and is not ready for production use.
